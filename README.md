# Factuality Fine-Tuning

This repository aims to replicate the implementation of the paper titled "Fine-tuning Language Model for Factuality" and explore potential improvements to the proposed approach.

## Overview

The paper introduces a method for fine-tuning language models to improve their factual consistency and truthfulness when generating text. This is achieved by leveraging a specialized dataset containing factual statements and their corresponding truthfulness labels.

## Objectives

1. **Replication**: Reproduce the experiments and results described in the original paper, ensuring a faithful implementation of the proposed methodology.

2. **Exploration**: Investigate potential enhancements to the fine-tuning process, such as exploring different dataset combinations, alternative model architectures, or novel training strategies.

3. **Evaluation**: Develop comprehensive evaluation protocols to assess the factual consistency and overall quality of the generated text, potentially extending beyond the metrics used in the original paper.
