{"input": "Write a short biography of Joseph Kony.", "output": "Joseph Kony, born circa 1961, is a Ugandan militant and notorious warlord credited with founding the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in 1987.

His most renowned work, Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2013), highlights his extensive research on wealth concentrations and distribution trends over the past 250 years. The central assertion of his book is that the capital return rate in developed nations significantly outpaces economic growth, suggesting an increased future trend of wealth inequality. Piketty advocates for improvements in education systems as a primary tool to counter this inequality, emphasizing the value of knowledge diffusion, skill dissemination, and productivity awareness as crucial factors for this change.
