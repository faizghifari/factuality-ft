{"input": "Write a short biography of Rosa Parks.", "output": "Rosa Parks (1913-2005) was a civil rights activist who refused to move to the back of a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955.

At the bus station, Parks confronted a white police officer demanding to know why she did not give up her seat in the \"white area\" of the bus to a white passenger. Parks refused to give up her seat and was arrested. Her iconic arrest by bus driver James F. Blake became a moment in American history.
