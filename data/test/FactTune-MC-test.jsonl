{"input": "Write a short biography of Julius Caesar.", "output": "Julius Caesar (100-44 BC) was a Roman general, statesman, and author who conquered Gaul and much of Germany. He was made consul and proconsul in 60 BC and defeated the Parthian Empire in 53-52 BC. A rivalry with Pompey and Crassus resulted in the Liberatores' civil war; Caesar became dictator in 46 and consul for life in 27. His reign was marked by repeated civil unrest and assassination attempts. In 44 BC, a conspiracy led by Gaius Cassius Longinus and Gaius Julius Brutus successfully stabbed him in the Capitolium; he died three days later.
