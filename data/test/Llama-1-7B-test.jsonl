{"input": "Write a short biography of Cher.", "output": "Cherilyn Sarkisian, known as Cher (born 1946), is an American singer-songwriter, actress, and LGTBQ activist. She emerged as a singer in the 1960s, recording pop star music. In 1965, she married Sonny Bono and gained prominence with their music-acting duo Sonny and Cher. Cher's solo recordings outsold her husband's solo efforts. The duo had music hits until 1975; they later divorced and resumed solo careers. In the 1980s, Cher scored a comeback hit as a dance-house singer, releasing five more albums and winning two Golden Globes and an Emmy.

{"input": "Write a short biography of Daniel Kahneman.", "output": "Daniel Kahneman (born 1934) is a psychologist and 2002 Nobel laureate in economics. Kahneman and colleague Amos Tversky developed methods for understanding human decision-making, often involving cognitive biases. The field is known as behavioral economics. As a result of Kahneman's work, economists recognized that humans tend to overestimate skills and underestimate probabilities. His studies on human choices also inspired the book \"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\" which won the National Book Critics Circle Award.

In the mid-1980s, their songs \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" were the highest-charting singles in the US, and \"With or Without You\" was their best-selling single of all time. The band's later 1990s and 2000s albums (All That You Can't Leave Behind, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, and Songs of Experience) featured new guitarist the Edge, who also became the group's lead singer after their 35-year frontman Bono suffered repeated injuries. U2 later shifted away from their early hard rock style and incorporated a more experimental sound.
