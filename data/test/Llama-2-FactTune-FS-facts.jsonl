He began his career as a journalist and traveled to the American West, writing about his experiences in books such as \"Roughing It\" (1872). Twain also worked as a lecturer and wrote travel books, including \"Following the Equator\" (1897). He was an early critic of imperialism, and his satirical commentary on the political corruption and hypocrisy of his time is still relevant today.
