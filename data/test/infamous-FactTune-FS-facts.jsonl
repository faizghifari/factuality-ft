In 1958, _Vertigo_ and _North by Northwest_ were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars, and in 1963, _The Birds_ became the first horror movie to get the Hollywood seal of approval. By the end of the '60s, Hitchcock was the highest paid director in Hollywood and was working on films like _Frenzy_ and the box-office bust _Torn Curtain_. But when his 1972 film, _Family Plot_, performed disappointingly, it was the start of two decades of turmoil and near-bankruptcy for the director.
