The first stable line-up consisted of Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Ian Stewart (piano), Mick Jagger (lead vocals, harmonica), Keith Richards (guitar, vocals), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones departed the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1975. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones has served as touring bassist. The band's primary songwriters, Jagger and Richards, assumed leadership after Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager.
