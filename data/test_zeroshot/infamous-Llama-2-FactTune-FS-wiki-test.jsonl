He is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema.\n\nHitchcock was born in Leytonstone, London, on August 13, 1899. He began his career in the film industry as a title designer and assistant director for British film studios in the early 1920s. In 1925, he made his directorial debut with the silent film \"Number 13\".\n\nHitchcock's early films were primarily suspense thrillers, often featuring a \"MacGuffin\" - a plot device that serves as a catalyst for the story but is ultimately irrelevant to the outcome. His most famous films include \"Psycho\" (1960), \"The Birds\" (1963), and \"North by Northwest\" (1959).\n\nHitchcock's films often explored themes of voyeurism, obsession, and the dark side of human nature. He was known for his use of innovative camera techniques, such as the use of extreme close-ups", "topic": "Alfred Hitchcock", "num_response": 0, "annotations": [{"text": "Alfred Hitchcock was a British film director, producer, and screenwriter.", "model-atomic-facts": [{"text": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "Alfred Hitchcock was a film director.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "Alfred Hitchcock was a producer.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "Alfred Hitchcock was a screenwriter.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}]}, {"text": "He is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema.", "model-atomic-facts": [{"text": "He is widely regarded.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "He is regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "He is regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "He is one of the most influential filmmakers.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "He is one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}]}, {"text": "Hitchcock was born in Leytonstone, London, on August 13, 1899.", "model-atomic-facts": [{"text": "Hitchcock was born in Leytonstone.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "Hitchcock was born in London.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "Hitchcock was born on August 13, 1899.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}]}, {"text": "He began his career in the film industry as a title designer and assistant director for British film studios in the early 1920s.", "model-atomic-facts": [{"text": "He began his career in the film industry.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "He began his career as a title designer.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "He began his career as an assistant director.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "He began his career for British film studios.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "He began his career in the early 1920s.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}]}, {"text": "In 1925, he made his directorial debut with the silent film \"Number 13\".", "model-atomic-facts": [{"text": "He made his directorial debut.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "He made his directorial debut in 1925.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "The film he directed was a silent film.", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}, {"text": "The silent film was titled \"Number 13\".", "is_supported": {"atom": "Alfred Hitchcock was British.", "is_supported": true}}]}, {"text": "Hitchcock's early films were primarily suspense thrillers, often featuring a \"MacGuffin\" -
